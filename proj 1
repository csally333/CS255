Author: Cameron Salazar
Course: CS255
Date: August 24, 2025

1. Executive Summary
DriverPass needs a unified platform to improve driving test outcomes by combining online written-test preparation with scheduled, in-person driving instruction. The system will let students study, practice, and book lessons; instructors manage availability and record feedback; and administrators oversee users, content, and performance.

2. Business Need and Problem
- Many learners fail driving tests due to inadequate preparation, limited instruction access, and poor coordination.
- DriverPass seeks a hybrid solution that centralizes study tools, lesson scheduling, and progress tracking at an affordable price.

3. Stakeholders and Users
- Client sponsor / leadership
- Administrators
- Instructors
- Students (primary end users)

4. Scope
In scope (initial release)
- Student registration, login, and package purchase
- Online practice exams with instant scoring and feedback
- Lesson scheduling with instructor availability and locations
- Instructor schedule management and lesson feedback entry
- Admin dashboards for user, schedule, and content management
- Progress tracking for scores, lessons, and completion history
- Browser and mobile-friendly access

Out of scope (initial release)
- Real-time vehicle location
- DMV system integration
- Multi-language content beyond English

5. Objectives and Measurable Goals
- Students can create accounts and purchase packages within minutes
- Page responses under normal load ≤ 3 seconds
- Practice exams provide immediate scores and explanations
- Scheduling prevents double-booking and surfaces nearest availability
- Administrators can generate usage and performance reports
- Secure authentication with optional two-factor for staff

6. Functional Requirements (examples)
- The system shall validate user credentials on login.
- The system shall allow students to register and choose a training package.
- The system shall allow students to take practice tests and receive feedback.
- The system shall allow students to schedule, reschedule, and cancel driving lessons.
- The system shall display instructor availability and lesson locations.
- The system shall allow instructors to manage availability and record lesson notes.
- The system shall track student test scores, lesson progress, and schedule history.
- The system shall allow administrators to manage users, content, and reports.

7. Nonfunctional Requirements
Performance and platform
- Web-based application usable on modern browsers and mobile devices
- Typical page response ≤ 3 seconds under normal load
- Quarterly content and feature updates

Technology constraints
- Runs on Windows and macOS via browser
- Backend uses a scalable relational database (MySQL or PostgreSQL)
- Cloud deployment on AWS or Azure supported

Security and accuracy
- Unique user ID per account; case-sensitive usernames and passwords
- HTTPS/TLS for all data in transit
- After five failed login attempts, lock account temporarily and alert admin
- Password reset via verified email; optional two-factor authentication

Adaptability and administration
- Roles and privileges configurable via admin UI without code changes
- Compatible with ongoing web and mobile OS updates
- IT admin access to logs, database views, and user controls

8. User Interface Needs
- Consistent, accessible browser and mobile experience
- Students: purchase packages, take exams, schedule lessons, view progress
- Instructors: view calendars, manage appointments, submit feedback
- Administrators: dashboards for users, schedules, content, and reports

9. Assumptions
- Users have internet-connected devices and basic digital literacy
- Instructors maintain their availability
- Curriculum content is provided by DriverPass specialists

10. Limitations and Constraints
- Budget and staff availability limit scope and pace
- English-only content at first release
- DMV integration deferred

11. Risks and Mitigations
- Scheduling conflicts → enforce atomic booking and conflict checks
- High traffic during exam periods → scale app tier and cache read-heavy content
- Security threats → MFA for staff, rate limiting, audit trails, regular patching

12. Success Metrics and KPIs
- Task completion time for registration and scheduling
- Practice exam completion rates and average scores
- Lesson no-show rate reduction
- Uptime and page response times
- User satisfaction ratings

13. Schedule
- See attached Gantt chart (Lucidchart) aligning to interview plan
